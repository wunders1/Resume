            <h2>CAREER PROFILE</h2> 
            <p>A warehouse manager with over a decade of experience at all levels of the small sporting goods business with a passion in Web Development. I am keen to transfer my strong work ethic and inquisitive mindset into the technology industry. Completing self guided learning and training through the Front End Web Development course at General Assembly, have allowed me to build the skills and knowledge in website building languages, dynamic websites, responsive design, good writing practices and debug methodologies.
            <br>
            My good problem solving, attention to detail, organisational skills and customer focused mindset have been at the core of my success in the wholesale environment which I believe are key skills transferable to Web Development. My role required me to build and maintain close relationships with regular clients and establish unique and specific workflows for each one. I regularly need to solve technical and physical problems to ensure staff work in a safe and efficient environment and our customers experience excellent service. I have a high attention to detail and along with time awareness, which strengthens my organisational ability to work to both time and deadlines. I am a self-motivated individual worker who is also a dedicated team player. </p>
